Payroll Manager is a backend application written in Go that manages employees and calculates their monthly payslips according to the Spanish labor and tax system.  It uses calcsalary, a custom Go library developed by the same author, to compute payroll breakdowns including gross salary, taxes (IRPF), and social security contributions.
